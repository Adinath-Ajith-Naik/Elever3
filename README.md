This project was developed, represnting IEEE MBCET CS SBC, for WebDez- Elever Competition organized by IEEE CS Kerala Chapter. Pixel is a website for users to upload posts and like them. Users can login and add categories for the posts to filter them and view the posts easily. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.1, with Google Firebase used as its back-end and hosted on Heroku. 

## How it Works?
1. A login button on top right to get access as a user or an admin.
2. An admin side to add new categories, new posts, and view votes received for each post.
3. User can view all uploaded posts and each logged-in user can cast only one vote on any of the posts.
4. A category filter is added on the page where the posts are displayed so that the viewer can filter the posts they see.


## How to Configure

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
